# Project2MemoryGame_GwG-Udacity
This is my Project2-Memory Game for the: "Grow with Google-Udacity Front End Developer NanoDegree Scholarship"

I FOLLOWED MY STRONG DESIRE HERE TO EXPRESS MY CREATIVE THOUGHTS TO BUILD A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEMORY GAME. THIS CONCEPT IS BASED ON BRIGHT, YELLOW, SUNSHINE CIRCLES THAT PUSH THE USER'S MOOD TO HAPPY FEELINGS OF BRIGHT, WARM, FUN THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THE USER'S EMOTIONS WILL THEN CREATE A DESIRE TO KEEP PLAYING THE "HAPPY YELLOW SUNSHINE CIRCLES GAME" OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN LOL. I INTEND TO COMEBACK LATER TO ADD "WARM, HAPPY, SUNSHINE-RELATED" ICONS TO INCREASE THE USER'S HAPPY, EMOTIONAL FEELINGS!



MY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE "HAPPY YELLOW SUNSHINE CIRCLES" GAME:
Can You Beat This Funnnnn Game ? ? ?
MATCH THE LETTERS INSIDE THE HAPPY YELLOW CIRCLES OF SUNSHINE
There are 7 letters and 1 number to match
THE LETTERS AND NUMBER ARE: C - I - R - C - L - E - 8
PLAY RIGHT NOW ..... Relax, Laugh, and have Fun!!!

WHAT DO THE 'Skyblue Sunshine Stars' TELL YOU ??
4 to 5 Skyblue Stars === You are really Happy :)
1 to 2 Skyblue Stars === You're kinda Sad :
3 Skyblue Stars === You Are Mellow Yellow lol :|

JAVASCRIPT LOGIC WAS INSPIRED PRIMARILY BY:
1) YAHYA ELHARONY @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8J13lmApkQ&t=2689s . THE YOUNG MAN GAVE AN EXCELLENT PROJECT WALKTHROUGH. HE CLEARLY AND THROUGHLY EXPLAINED THE JAVASCRIPT LOGIC, LINE BY LINE, AND PATIENTLY ASKED FOR QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT TUTORIAL!, 

AND BY, 

2) WALTER GUEVARA, "THE SOFTWARE DUDE" @ http://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6417/how-to-code-blackjack-using-javascript . PRACTICING HIS BLACKJACK CARD GAME GAVE ME AN UP-CLOSE, 1ST HAND UNDERSTANDING OF THE JAVASCRIPT LOGIC USED TO BUILD MEMORY CARD GAMES, 

AND BY, 

3) ADAM KHOURY, "THE WEB DEV COMEDIAN", @ http://www.developphp.com/video/JavaScript/Memory-Game-Programming-Tutorial . HE SAYS MORE IN HIS 5 TO 10 MINUTE VIDEOS THAN MANY SAY IN 1-HOUR VIDEOS. HIS LOGIC IS CONSISTENTLY CLEAR, CONCISE, IMMEDIATELY FUNCTIONAL, FUN, AND MANY "AH HA" MOMENTS!
