frontend-nanodegree-feedreader using Jasmine
===============================

Project-4 The Feedreader using Jasmine. Rubric for the GwG-Udacity Nanodegree Scholarship.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

The Technologies used to complete this project.
--------------------------------------------
The feedreader tests were written using Jasmine. The html, css, javascript, feeds, apis, etc were provided by Udacity. Shout-outs to the great walkthrough videos that helped me from Lloan Alas, Alain Cadenat, Mohammed Riaad, Ryan Waite, and Ryan Boris.

Why this Project?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

How will this help my career?
----------------------------------------------
* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
