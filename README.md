# Landing Page-mcdonalds-menu
This is a clone of the landing page displayed for guest at McDonald's who use their free wifi. I rebuilt it as a great example of minimalist artwork that maximizes white space, imagery, spacing, positioning, content, and ux/ui design strategies. It is a great example of ... "Less is More". 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
html5, css3, javascript, mobile responsive, web accessible, GITHUB , npm, webpack, NETLIFY, lighthouse audit, NVDA, etc.

## ACCESSIBILITY: 
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
