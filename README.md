# email_landingpg-mcdonalds-menu

This is a landing page clone of McDonald's menu website. This website appears when you click to sign into their free wifi at their restaurants. I was impressed with the power and simplicity of the design and the high-quality images. I re-built this website with pure html5, css3, and javascript. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, javascript, mobile responsive, web accessible, GITHUB , npm, NETLIFY .
